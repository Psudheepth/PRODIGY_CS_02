Simple Image Encryption Tool
Overview
This project is part of Task #02 of the Prodigy Infotech Internship in Cyber Security. It involves developing a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. The tool performs operations like swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images.

Features
Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values.
Decrypt images to their original form.
Easy-to-use interface for selecting images and specifying encryption parameters.
